# Utility functions for Padrino Database Digitizers to test and debug models

This package helps Padrino digitizers quickly load and test models that
theyâ€™ve just entered into the database. It is not intended for use by
non-digitizers. Please use
[`RPadrino`](https://github.com/levisc8/RPadrino) instead.
