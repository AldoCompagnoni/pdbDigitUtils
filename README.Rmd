# Utility functions for Padrino Database Digitizers to test and debug models

This package helps Padrino digitizers quickly load and test models that they've just entered into the database. It is not intended for use by non-digitizers. Please use [`Rpadrino`](https://github.com/padrinoDB/Rpadrino) instead.
